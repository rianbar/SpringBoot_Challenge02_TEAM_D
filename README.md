## E-COMMERCE PROJECT â˜•

### Hi everyone, i would like to present a project that was done by my internship group, this project consists of a ecommerce based on a microservice architecture. Well, we have three microservice connect by **feign** and they all have great importance in the operation of the application.

### MS-ORDERS ðŸš²
**Endpoints:**<br>
>CREATE_ORDER: `localhost:8000/orders`<br>
>GET_ORDER_BY_ID: `localhost:8000/orders/{id}`<br>
>CANCEL_ORDER: `localhost:8000/orders/{id}/cancel`<br>
>UPDATE_ORDER: `localhost:8000/orders/{id}`<br>
>GET_ALL_ORDERS: `localhost:8000/orders`<br>

#### Request payload to create order:

~~~~
{
    "products": [
        {
            "productId": 6,
            "quantity": 2
        },
        {
            "productId": 3,
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ],
    "address": {
        "street": "Av. do AlemÃ£o",
        "number": 2,
        "postalCode": "65919-2701"
    },

}
~~~~

> `PaymentMethod` field can only be `CREDIT_CARD, BANK_TRANSFER, CRYPTOCURRENCY, GIFT_CARD, PIX or OTHER`.

#### Resquest payload to cancel order:

~~~~
{
    "cancelReason": "message"
}
~~~~

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> If the order that you want to cancel has `status` field as `SENT` or the creation date exceeds **90 days**, you cannot cancel that order.
> The payload of the update endpoint is the same as the creation one, but if the order you want to update has a status of `SENT` or `CANCELED`, you can update it.
